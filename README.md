## Traditional FreeRTOS Distribution
You can find the [Traditional FreeRTOS Distribution in this repo](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/FreeRTOS). This distribution contains everything which you used to find in the FreeRTOS zip file download except for the tests which have been moved to a new location. For more information see the [readme file on where to find the demos now](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/FreeRTOS/blob/master/FreeRTOS/readme.md)

## Creating your own FreeRTOS project
If you are looking for an example of how to put your own FreeRTOS project together the [BlinkyDemo](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/demo_blinky) is the simplest place to start. This is a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) which means you can use it to automatically create your own repo at the push of a button. 

If you are an expert and you are just looking for the FreeRTOS Kernel only because you want to include it in your project you will find the [Kernel-Only](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/FreeRTOS-Kernel) repo helpful.   

## Testing
Most of the repos in the org have corresponding test repositories which can easily be found using the search bar. 

If you are specifically looking for the Kernel Tests they can be found [here](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/test_freertos_kernel)

For more information on how to test your own port you will want to start [here](https://github.com/FuschiaPlatinumFoxTerrier/test_freertos_ports)
